I generally like to merge master into the development first so that if there are any conflicts, 
I can resolve in the development branch itself and my master remains clean.

(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)

If you want to keep track of who did the merge and when, 
you can use --no-ff flag while merging to do so.
This is generally useful only when merging development into the master (last step)
