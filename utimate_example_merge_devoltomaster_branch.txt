I generally like to merge master into the development first so that if there are any conflicts, 
I can resolve in the development branch itself and my master remains clean.

(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff development
or
git merge development #(there won't be any conflicts now)
## merges files in localhost. Master shouldnâ€™t have any  commits ahead, 
#otherwise there will be a need for pull and merging code by hands!
git push

If you want to keep track of who did the merge and when, 
you can use --no-ff flag while merging to do so.
This is generally useful only when merging development into the master (last step)

Deleting a remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch>  # Git version 1.7.0 or newer
git push origin -d <branch>        # Shorter version (Git 1.7.0 or newer)
git push origin :<branch>          # Git versions older than 1.7.0

Deleting a local branch
git branch --delete <branch>
git branch -d <branch> # Shorter version
git branch -D <branch> # Force-delete un-merged branches
